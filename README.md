# Covid App Sagas

I have built a COVID-19 application in React, where users can input a country name to access related statistics like the number of patients and recoveries. 

This application employs the latest industry-standard techniques and advanced programming concepts, utilizing store, sagas, and the useReducer hook to update values. 

It is user-friendly and has undergone extensive testing to guarantee its reliability and precision.
